# A Real Time Vehicle Counting System using YOLO
**You only look once (YOLO)** is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. YOLO algorithm employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect objects in real-time.  </br>
**Object detection** is a phenomenon in computer vision that involves the detection of various objects in digital images or videos. Object detection consists of various approaches such as fast R-CNN, Retina-Net, and Single-Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD).
